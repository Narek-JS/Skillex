### ‚ú® Features

- **Multi-Criteria Filtering:** Filter products simultaneously by category, brand, price range (with a slider), and star rating.
- **Real-Time Updates:** The product grid updates instantly as filter selections are made, without page reloads.
- **Product Sorting:** Sort the filtered products by different criteria such as popularity and price.
- **Session Persistence:** User's selected filters and sort preferences are saved to `localStorage`, so they are retained on page refresh.
- **Performance Optimized:** Filtering logic is optimized using the `useMemo` hook, and input is debounced to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **User Feedback:** Includes a loading spinner during data fetching and a clear "No products found" message for empty states.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** The project includes a robust suite of unit and component tests to ensure reliability.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
